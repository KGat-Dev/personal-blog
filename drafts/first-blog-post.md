The tug of war between Peace & Building Wealth

Created April 17, 2021

Most of us, at some point, ask how to be free and how to feel happy. Free to choose how to spend our time, to meet our basic needs, and to pursue our sense of calling.

This page is an amalgam of my reflections on finding inner peace and creating wealth. Two topics that seem mutually exclusive. I believe that whatever field you are drawn to, or naturally good at, can become a path to meaningful income. De facto, doing something you like or can at least tolarate, moves you closer to peace. Iam still very much on this path myself; what you’ll find here is not a conclusion, but an honest record of my learning and progress along the way.
